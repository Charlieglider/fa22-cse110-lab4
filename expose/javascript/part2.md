1. Prints 3, which is the length of prices.length
2. Prints 150, which is a variable that holds the discountedprice before the final price is applied
3. Prints 150, which is the final discounted price, with roudning and scaling applied. 
4. Returns [50, 100, 150] an array holding all the discounted prices
5. Causes error, because i is only defined in the scope of its block
6. Causes error because discountedPrice is only defined in the scope of its block
7. Prints out 150 (finalPrice) because let finalPrice =0 was declared in the main block so there is no issue. 
8. Prints [50, 100, 150] an array holding all the discounted prices, because let discounted = []; is declared in the main block so there are no issues.
9. Returns error, i is not defined because let i=0 means its only declared in the for loop block
10. Prints 3, which is the length of the prices array because const doesn't affect the scope just stops reassignment. 
11. returns discounted array [50, 100, 150], because const has nothing to do with immutability it just stops reassignment. Meaning discounted.push will still work.

H. NaN

4. Comparison
A. true
B. false

5. == does type conversion of operands before comparison while === compares the values as well as operand data types

7. Functions
result would be a modified array [2,4,6]
goes through array and rewrites (pushes) a value that is *2 the original using the doSomething function.
